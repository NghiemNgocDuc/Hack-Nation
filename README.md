*Voice Risk Detection Platform
A real-time browser-based system for detecting scam speech and voice spoofing. It streams audio, transcribes multilingual speech using Whisper ASR, and analyzes transcripts and audio for high-risk indicators. The platform integrates VAD, anti-spoofing models, and keyword-based risk scoring, with a responsive frontend that visualizes alerts and transcripts live.
